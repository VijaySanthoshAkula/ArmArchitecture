1.	Precession of the number is formed by both exponent and fractional part, but fractional part is most prominent one in defining 
precession. As number of bits in fractional part increases precession or accuracy increases that’s the reason for single precession 
and double precession. The equation for single Precession is
(-1)s *(1.0+fraction)*(2)e-127
And Equation for Double Precession is
 (-1)s *(1.0+fraction)*(2)e-1023
For Example if we want to know precession of a floating point number whose Hexadecimal Representation is 40CAAAAB and Decimal Representation is 6.333333492279053 in single and double precession then it is as follows
Single Precession:
SignBit: 0
Exponent: 10000001
Fraction: 1 .10010101010101010101011
Double Precession:
SignBit: 0
Exponent: 10000000001
Fraction: 1 .1001010101010101010101100000000000000000000000000000
Whose decimal equivalent is 6.3333334922790530. 
So as seen from above discussion Fractional part major role in precession.

2.	Normal and Subnormal Values as per IEEE 754
Precision is increased by this IEEE 754 standard normalized significand which implies most significant bit of significand is always 1. 
So according to this standard significand is 24 bits long where 23 bits is stored in memory and implied one is shown as below.
Normal representation in the IEEE Standard is (– 1) s × (1. f ) 2 × 2exponent – 127 
s is the sign bit
 f represents the bits in the significand. 
 1 is the most significant bit of the significand and is explicitly shown.
Example: 
SignBit: 0
Exponent: 10000001
Fraction: 1 .10010101010101010101011
Decimal Representation: 6.33333349
Subnormal Numbers:
In Subnormal Numbers exponent bits are 0 and leading hidden bit is 0. Representation is as follows
(–1)s × 0.f × 2power(–127)
Example:
Sign: 0 
Exponent: 00000000 
Fraction: 00000000000000000010001


3.	IEEE 754vv Standards of Floating Point Number Rounding types:
round to nearest ties to even: rounded to nearest even value
Ex: Original Value: 7.5
      Rounded Value: 8
      Original Value: 6.5
      Rounded Value: 6
round down: This is like rounding towards negative infinity
Ex: Original Value: 7.5
      Rounded Value: 7

round up: This is like rounding towards positive Infinity
Ex: Original Value: 7.5
      Rounded Value: 8

round towards zero: This is like round away from infinity or roundind towards zero
Ex: Original Value: 6.5
      Rounded Value: 6

round away from zero: This is like rounding away from zero.
Ex: Original Value: 6.5
      Rounded Value: 7
