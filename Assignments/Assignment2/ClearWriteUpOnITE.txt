ITE Condition(If Then and Else) 

1. We are seeing the Errors after building the first code because The instructions following the "IT" instruction should be conditional or should contain conditional code within them like "MOVGT" or "ADDGT" etc, But the instructions following "IT" instruction in first example code are not conditional i.e "MOV" they don't contain conditional code. "A1619E Specified condition is not consistent with previous IT" occurs when the instructions following "IT" does not contain the same conditional code as the one specified in "IT" instruction, but in our code instructions following the "IT" doesn't comply with the rules.
So inorder to solve the error we must append conditional code "LT" to "MOV" instruction for "IT" part i.e 3 "MOV" Instructions following ITTTE should be appended by "LT"and append "GE" to "MOV" instruction for "Else" part since the ELSE condition must be the inverse of the THEN condition these two fields differ only in the LSB of the encoding.
Corrected sequence is:
ITTTE LT ; or N != V
MOVLT R3, #0x100
MOVLT R8, #0x200
MOVLT R7, #0x200
MOVGE R6, #0x200

2. We Don't see any error after building second code because the instructions following "IT" instruction are Conditional instructions and contain conditional codes for IF part and Else part are according to the rule "ELSE condition must be the inverse of the THEN condition these two fields differ only in the LSB of the encoding".
For Example ADDLT of IF part and SUBGE of Else part.
